# Unit tests and coverage

Unit tests run with Vite+ (`vp test run`, vitest 5 inside). They cover the **TypeScript** of `layers/` and `apps/`
(composables, stores, plugins, middleware, server routes, utils, lib). `.vue` pages and components are covered by the
Playwright suites (`*/e2e`), not by the unit metric. Those run against an in-repo mock of the API, with no secret: how to
write and run them is in `layers/engine/e2e/mock/README.md` (CI job "E2E (mock)").

```bash
pnpm test                                             # all projects, ~25 s
pnpm exec vp test run layers/engine/stores            # one folder / file
pnpm exec vp test run -t "removes the line"           # by test title
pnpm exec vp test run --project unit                  # only the plain-node project (fastest, no Nuxt boot)
pnpm exec vp test run --sequence.shuffle --sequence.seed=7  # random order: the suite must pass in any order
pnpm run test:coverage                                # coverage + thresholds (what CI runs); report in coverage/
```

`coverage/lcov-report/index.html` is the browsable report. The thresholds in `vite.config.ts`
(`test.coverage.thresholds`) only ever go up: a global one, and one per file for the files of the order, auth and payment
flows (`criticalFiles`), held at what they reach: 100 % everywhere except the few defensive arms of `useOrderCompleted`
(a cleanup before mount, which only runs during SSR), `useOrderTracking` and `useOrderQuote` (guards for an inactive
scope / a coupon that is gone), which stay on purpose.

## Where tests go and how they are named

A test sits **next to the file it tests, one test file per module** (`foo.ts` has `foo.test.mjs`, `foo.nuxt.test.ts` or
`foo.server.test.ts`, not a second `foo.edge.test.ts`: add the case to the file that exists). Its suffix picks the
environment (the vitest "project"):

| Suffix                              | Project           | Environment                                         | For                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*.test.mjs`, `*.test.ts`           | `unit`            | plain Node, no Nuxt                                 | pure code: `utils/`, `lib/`, anything without auto-imports              |
| `*.nuxt.test.ts`                    | `nuxt`            | the real Nuxt app of `apps/tokyosushi` in happy-dom | composables, stores, plugins, route middleware                          |
| `*.ygfliege.nuxt.test.ts`           | `nuxt-ygfliege`   | the real Nuxt app of `apps/ygfliege` in happy-dom   | code whose behaviour depends on the brand                               |
| `apps/ygfliege/**/*.nuxt.test.ts`   | `nuxt-ygfliege`   | same                                                | the YGF app's own plugins, data, components' logic                      |
| `*.server.test.ts`                  | `server`          | Node + h3, Nitro's auto-imports as globals          | `server/routes`, `server/api`, `server/middleware`                      |
| `apps/ygfliege/**/*.server.test.ts` | `server-ygfliege` | same, with `#brand` = ygfliege                      | the YGF app's handlers (and `robots.txt`, which runs under both brands) |

Prefer the lightest project that works. A function that needs nothing from Nuxt belongs in `utils/` and gets a
`*.test.mjs` or `*.test.ts` (see the existing ones next to the utils for the style: `node:assert/strict` or `expect`, both work).

Always `import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vite-plus/test'` (the lint rule `prefer-vite-plus-imports` enforces it).
Aliases `#engine` and `#brand` resolve in every project (`#brand` is the brand of the project's app). Code that is the same
for both brands is tested once, in the tokyosushi project; code that differs gets a `*.ygfliege.nuxt.test.ts` next to it
that asserts the YGF values, in the real YGF app (no swapping of `#brand/brand`).
`vi.mock('#brand/brand', ...)` is only for a brand shape that neither shipped brand has (see
`useOrderExtras.restricted.nuxt.test.ts`).

Every project resets spies, stubbed globals and stubbed env after each test (`restoreMocks`, `unstubGlobals`,
`unstubEnvs`), and unmounts every mounted component (`test/setup/vue.ts`). Whatever else a test overrides (a property of
`window`, `document`, `navigator`, a module-level state), it puts back itself: `test/helpers/viewport.ts` does it for the
window size. The suite must pass in any order: `--sequence.shuffle` is part of the check, and it needs per-file isolation
(`--isolate=false` is not supported: module mocks are per file).

Shared builders and helpers live in `test/` at the repo root:

- `test/fixtures/auth.ts`: `makeUser` (the signed-in customer, as `me` answers it; the one `makeUser`)
- `test/fixtures/catalog.ts`: `makeProduct`, `makeChoice`, `makeCartItem`
- `test/fixtures/quote.ts`: `makeQuote`, `makeQuoteLine` (a `quoteOrder` answer)
- `test/fixtures/order.ts`: `makeOrder`, `makeOrderItem`, `makePayment`, `makeUser` (a placed order, as `myOrder` returns it)
- `test/flags.ts`: `setFlags({ server, client, dev })`, see "SSR-only and dev-only code"
- `test/helpers/`: `i18n.ts`, `gqlFetch.ts`, `mountComposable.ts`, see "Composables that talk to the API"; also
  `fakeOidc.ts` (oidc-client-ts's `UserManager`, to run the real `useOidc` over a fake Zitadel), `fakeObservers.ts`
  (IntersectionObserver / ResizeObserver), `viewport.ts` (window size and scroll), `settle.ts` (see "No sleeps")
- `test/nitro/callHandler.ts` and `test/nitro/imports.ts`: run a Nitro handler, set its runtime config
- `test/setup/*`: setup files of the projects (no network, flag reset)

Import them with a relative path (`'../../../test/fixtures/catalog'`) so that `nuxi typecheck` resolves them too.

## The `nuxt` project: composables, stores, plugins, middleware

`@nuxt/test-utils` boots the real app (layers, auto-imports, Pinia, i18n, runtime config) once per test file. Real is
the default: use the real stores, real `useState`, real i18n, real runtime config, and mock only the boundaries.

```ts
import { mockNuxtImport } from '@nuxt/test-utils/runtime'
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vite-plus/test'
```

Pinia: give each test a fresh one. Without the persistence plugin unless the test is about persistence.

```ts
setActivePinia(createPinia())
const cart = useCartStore()
```

For persistence use the real plugin on an app: `pinia.use(createPersistedState()); createApp({}).use(pinia)` (see
`persistedStore()` in `layers/engine/stores/cart.nuxt.test.ts`). The store hydrates when it is created. Pinia ignores
mutations made in the same tick as a `$patch`, so `await nextTick()` before mutating and asserting on the written storage.

`vi.mock` / `mockNuxtImport` are hoisted: the values they use must come from `vi.hoisted(...)`. A module that is
mocked must be imported **after** the mocks: `const { default: plugin } = await import('./gqlFetch')`.

### Composables that talk to the API

The GraphQL transport (`$gqlFetch`, used by `useGqlMutation`, `useGqlQuery` and `useNuxtApp().$gqlFetch`) is a read-only
getter on the Nuxt app, so it is replaced by wrapping `useNuxtApp`; `vue-i18n`'s `useI18n` is replaced by a `t` that returns the
key and its params, so a test asserts WHICH message was chosen, not its wording; `mountComposable` runs a composable inside a real
component (`onMounted`, `onScopeDispose`, `useId`...).

```ts
const gqlFetch = vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn())
mockNuxtImport('useNuxtApp', async (original) => {
  const { withGqlFetch } = await import('../../../test/helpers/gqlFetch')
  return () => withGqlFetch(original(), gqlFetch)
})
vi.mock('vue-i18n', async (importOriginal) => {
  const { fakeI18n } = await import('../../../test/helpers/i18n')
  return { ...(await importOriginal<typeof import('vue-i18n')>()), useI18n: fakeI18n }
})

const { result, unmount } = mountComposable(() => useThing()) // from test/helpers/mountComposable
```

A composable with module-level state (a shared request cycle, a "backend is old" flag) is loaded fresh per test:
`vi.resetModules()` then `await import(...)` of it and of the stores and error classes it shares `instanceof` with
(see `useOrderQuote.nuxt.test.ts`, `useCouponCode.nuxt.test.ts`). Fake timers: `vi.useFakeTimers({ toFake: [...] })`
with only the timers the code uses, and `await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(ms)` to let promises settle.

### Plugins

A plugin file default-exports `defineNuxtPlugin(fn)`, which is the function itself: call it with a fake `nuxtApp` and
read what it returns (`{ provide: { gqlFetch } }`). The real app has also run it at boot; the test builds its own copy
with the mocks in place. See `layers/engine/plugins/gqlFetch.nuxt.test.ts`.

### Route middleware

`defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(fn)` is `fn`. Call it with a fake route, as in `layers/engine/middleware/auth.global.nuxt.test.ts`.

## The `server` project: Nitro handlers

Server code is compiled by Nitro, which auto-imports all of h3 and `useRuntimeConfig`. In this project h3's exports are
globals and `#imports` is a stand-in (`test/nitro/imports.ts`):

```ts
import { setRuntimeConfig } from '../../../../test/nitro/imports'
import { callHandler } from '../../../../test/nitro/callHandler'
import handler from './robots.txt'

setRuntimeConfig({ public: { baseUrl: 'https://tokyosushibarliege.be' } })
const response = await callHandler(handler, { path: '/robots.txt', headers: { ... }, method: 'POST', body: '...' })
expect(response.status).toBe(200)
expect(await response.text()).toContain('Sitemap:')
```

`callHandler` runs the handler through a real h3 app and returns a Web `Response`. A handler that imports
`nitropack/runtime` (`useStorage`, `defineCachedFunction`, `useNitroApp`) explicitly: mock that module with
`vi.mock('nitropack/runtime', () => ({ ... }))`. The runtime config is reset before every test. `useRuntimeConfig` and `$fetch` are globals here too, as in Nitro:
`$fetch` (from `test/nitro/imports.ts`) refuses any call until the test gives it an answer with `$fetch.mockResolvedValue(...)`.

## SSR-only and dev-only code

Nuxt replaces `import.meta.server`, `import.meta.client` and `import.meta.dev` with constants at build time, which makes
one side of every `if (import.meta.server)` unreachable. In the unit projects the sources of `layers/` and `apps/` are
rewritten so that each flag first reads a per-test override. Defaults: `nuxt` and `unit` are the browser (`client` true,
`server` false, `dev` false), `server` is Nitro (`server` true, `client` false, `dev` false).

```ts
import { setFlags } from '../../../test/flags'

it('does not touch localStorage during SSR', () => {
  setFlags({ server: true }) // also sets client: false; reset automatically after each test
  ...
})
```

This is a hybrid, not a server render: the app code takes its server path while happy-dom's `window`, `document` and
`localStorage` still exist and Nuxt itself runs as a client. A test with `setFlags({ server: true })` proves the server
BRANCH does the right thing (no listener, no storage write, the right header); it cannot prove that the code never touches
the DOM during a real SSR. That is still the job of `scripts/check-ssr-safety.mjs` and the Playwright suites.

Limits: only the sources of `layers/` and `apps/` are rewritten (not `node_modules`, so Nuxt itself keeps running as a
browser app); a flag read once at module load time (`const isServer = import.meta.server` at top level) is fixed at
import, so import the module after `setFlags` (`await import`) if a test needs it. Composables that call
`useRequestEvent()` on the server need `mockNuxtImport('useRequestEvent', ...)` to provide an event.

## The network is closed

`test/setup/noNetwork.ts` makes any `fetch`/`$fetch` to a host other than localhost fail with
`Unmocked network request blocked in unit tests`. A test that reaches Mollie, Zitadel, the API or S3 is wrong: mock the
boundary.

## No sleeps

A test never waits for a real duration. Time is faked (`vi.useFakeTimers`, advanced with `advanceTimersByTimeAsync`).
Work behind a lazy `import()` or a promise chain is awaited with `settle()` from `test/helpers/settle.ts` (the lazy imports
have loaded, the chains have run): use it BEFORE asserting that something did NOT happen, otherwise the assertion runs before
the thing could even start and passes for nothing. Prove a negative assertion can fail: break the guard it checks and watch it
go red. The booted app's own deferred work (auth-sync after `onNuxtReady`) is finished before the first test of a file
(`test/setup/nuxtReady.ts`): it acts on the active Pinia and would otherwise land in a random test.

## Writing good tests (the review bar)

- Assert behaviour: return values, state, calls made with the right arguments, errors surfaced. A test that only calls a
  function to light up lines is rejected.
- Critical flows (order, auth, payment) cover every branch, error paths included.
- Deterministic and fast: no real network, no sleeps, no dependence on test order or on the current date.
- Don't change production behaviour for testability. A branch that cannot be reached is dead code: report it instead of
  adding an ignore comment.
