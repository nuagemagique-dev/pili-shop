# Theme contract

Everything in `layers/engine` is written once and must render correctly in every brand. It therefore
talks to the theme through **names**, never through a brand's literal colours. Each brand maps the names
in its `tailwind.config.ts` (and `assets/css/*.css` for the HSL variables).

| Name                                       | Meaning                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary-50 … 900`                         | brand accent scale (red for Tokyo Sushi, orange for YGF); `primary` / `primary-hover` / `primary-soft` are the CTA fill, its hover and a tint |
| `neutral-50 … 900`                         | text, surface and border neutrals (gray for Tokyo Sushi, the YGF greys)                                                                       |
| `tsb-one … four`                           | page, container, decorative, selected                                                                                                         |
| `ring`                                     | keyboard focus ring colour (`--ring`)                                                                                                         |
| `red`, `amber`, `green`, `emerald`, `blue` | the same meaning in every brand: error, warning, success, completed, halal                                                                    |

`primary-*`/`neutral-*`/`tsb-*` class names stay stable; a brand may override a step where the raw scale
fails contrast (YGF: `backgroundColor.primary`, `textColor.primary`, `borderColor.neutral`).

## Accessibility rules the contract carries

- Text is 4.5:1 on every surface it sits on. Secondary text is `text-neutral-600`; `neutral-300/400/500`
  and `primary-300/400/500` are decorative steps (hairlines, separators, glyphs) and never carry text.
  Accent text is `text-primary-700` (hover `-800`); status text is `red-700`, `amber-800`, `green-800`,
  `emerald-700`.
- A CTA fill carrying white is `bg-primary-600` (hover `-700`) or bare `bg-primary`.
- Focus is `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring` (add `ring-offset-2` on filled controls), at
  least 3:1 (WCAG 1.4.11). Never `ring-<colour>-100…400`.
- Do not tell an error from the brand red by colour alone (Tokyo Sushi: red-600 vs red-700): pair it with
  an icon and the tinted box.
- **Danger guidance.** In Tokyo Sushi the brand accent _is_ red (`primary` = red-600), so a danger state has
  no colour of its own to hide behind: a CTA and an error would look alike. Anything that means "danger" (an
  error message, a refused payment, a destructive confirmation) is therefore never a bare red word or a red
  button: it is an alert icon plus a tinted box (`bg-red-50 border border-red-200 text-red-700`; `red-*` is
  reserved for errors), with a text that says what happened. Yangguofu keeps red out of its UI except for promos
  and errors, where the same icon and tinted box apply.

## Brand orange (Yangguofu)

`#F58220` stays the brand orange: GUIDELINES.md specifies it, and the franchisor's design kit uses `#EB6100`
(the kit is awaiting the franchisor's decision; do not switch before it comes). Decorative orange (large
surfaces, borders, glyphs, the loading bar) is that value; anything that carries white text or small text uses
the AA-corrected steps `--ygf-orange-on-white` (#C2570C), `--ygf-orange-on-white-hover` and `--ygf-orange-text`
(see `apps/ygfliege/assets/css/brand.css`). To change the orange: `YGF_ORANGE` in `apps/ygfliege/tailwind.config.ts`,
`--ygf-orange` in `brand.css` and the `theme-color` meta in `apps/ygfliege/nuxt.config.ts`.

## Dead tokens

The unused shadcn colours (`secondary`, `destructive`, `muted`, `accent`, `popover`, `card`) are gone from both
configs; use the contract names above. (`tsb-three` stays: the order-completed petals read it through `theme()`.)

## Guards (all run in `pnpm run lint`)

- `scripts/check-engine-boundaries.mjs`: the engine only uses the names above (no raw gray/orange/slate…,
  no hex colours, no brand-name literals).
- `scripts/check-token-contrast.mjs`: reads both brands' real configs and fails if a contract text colour,
  CTA fill or the focus ring drops below its ratio (`--table` prints every pair), and if a template
  uses pale secondary text.
- `scripts/check-focus-ring-contrast.mjs`: no `focus:ring-<colour>-100…400` utility in a template.

## Moving a file into the engine

Both apps used to hold near-identical copies of many components and pages; one copy now lives in
`layers/engine` and an app keeps a file only to override it (Nuxt resolves an app file over a layer
file of the same path). When you move one: write it with the contract names above, import siblings
through `#engine/components/...` (never `~/components/...`: `~` is the app) and brand data through
`#brand/...`, and take brand facts from `useAppConfig().brand` (`legalName`, `legalForm`,
`dishesLabel`, `deliveryEnabled`, `japaneseAccents`, ...) instead of keeping a per-brand copy.
